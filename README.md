Project Title: How to Make a Viral YouTube Video
Problem: What problem are we trying to solve? [0.25 point]
	There are hundreds of thousands of creators on YouTube that devote hours of work 
into their filming, editing, and publishing process. However, this does not guarantee that a creator will be able to reach their goals in views, new subscribers, and viewer interaction through likes and comments. Our purpose for this project is to identify the common traits of previously viral videos that allow creators maximum exposure to new audiences. 
 
Motivation: Why is this a problem? [0.25 point]
	YouTube is a huge platform with over 2 billion users who are constantly creating and 
viewing videos, so there is a constant demand for new videos for entertainment. However, with so many creators on YouTube, the industry is extremely competitive and it can be hard for newer creators to reach their desired audiences.
 
Features: When do we know that we have solved the problem? [0.25 point]
	We know that we have solved the problem when we are able to identify the traits 
that viral videos share, so that new creators can follow these traits as a formula for video publishing success.
 
Data: (Public data set we will be using and the link to the public data set) or (Schema of randomly generated data - i.e. what are the different columns in our dataset and the respective datatypes) [0.25 point]
	We will be using a public dataset from the website data.world. The link to this data 
set is: https://data.world/iamdilan/youtube-dataset.
 
Tools: Programming languages or any tools/frameworks we will be using [0.25 point]
	We will be using C++ for this project. We will have a menu that accepts 
user input.
 
Visuals: Wireframes/Sketches of the interface or the menu driven program [0.25 points] 
 1) Users will be able to search for the channels of viral content creators. The 
program will output the time it took to search through a binary tree vs a heap and a list of viral videos from that creator in the database.
2) Users will be able to search for a video by its tags or the full title to get information on 
the videoâ€™s like/dislike ratio, comment count, views, and publishing date and time. The program will again output the time it took to search through the binary tree vs a heap to find the video.
3 and 4) Users will be able to view some qualities of YouTube's most viral videos 
including what day of the week and at what time the video was published.
 
These are just some of the menu options we will include as we plan on having a few more.
